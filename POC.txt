Please find POC details.

 

We need to create REST API in mulesoft, which will get list of cards details associated with any account.

 

The URI would be like :

 

credit-card-accounts/${accountNumber}/get-cards
credit-card-accounts/get-cards
query parameter
                                                               i.      creditCardNumber

 

The validation on accountNumber and creditCardNumber will be :

 

length between 16 to 19
only numberic
both are mandatory
 

The response should like following

 

{

              [

              {

                            “cardType”:””,

                             “cardExpiryDate”: “”,

                             “cardLogo” : “”,

                             “cardHolderName” : “”

              },

              {

                             “cardType”:””,

                             “cardExpiryDate”: “”,

                             “cardLogo” : “”,

                             “cardHolderName” : “”

 

              }

]

}

 

 

In order to achieve the same you need to create two API, One api will request for get card list and another API will response to that, the 2nd API will get request like accountnumber or cardnumber and will find associated data from file and take associated cards details and send response to first API.

 

Handle logging, exception handling wisely.

 

Cover all scenario like, 200, 400,404, 500.
